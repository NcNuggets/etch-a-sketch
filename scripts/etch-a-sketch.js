/*  TO DO / HELPFUL PROPERTIES
    -- need to create a grid with js to satisify the project.
    -- need to create variable grid setup so that a user can enter any number between x and y to create a grid with those square dimensions, but using the same pixel area (960x960 say).
    -- the new grid should generate in the same total space as before (e.g. 960px wide) to create a new sketch pad
    -- can target the #container div inside index.html.
    -- set BORDERS and MARGINS to 0?
    -- need to set a div:hover action to change the content/background-color.
    -- need to use event listeners to look for the hover action start point in order to trigger the change.
    -- change the color of the divs by changing the css class.
    -- need to add a button that resets the grid.
    -- push to github
